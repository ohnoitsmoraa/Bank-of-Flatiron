# Code Challenge Wk1 ~ Bank of Flatiron

For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

The instructions below will walk you through the process of ideation and planning your app: deciding on your user interface, planning how the information will be laid out on the page, etc. You should work through all the planning steps before you start doing any coding.

## Requirements

For this project, you must:

- Have a well-written README file.
- Fetch data from a local server running JSON DB server.

## Project Setup & Pre-requisite Data

- In your project directory, create a db.json file and use this dataLinks to an external site. for your server DB.
- Run this command to get the backend started:
  `json-server --watch db.json`
  Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:
  `http://localhost:8001/transactions`

## Project Setup

Once you have the plan in place for the application you want to build take the following steps:

- Create a new project folder.
- Create a new GitHub repository (NB: ENSURE IT IS PRIVATE).
- Add your TM as a contributor to the project. (This is only for grading purposes)
- Please make sure you regularly commit to the repository.

## Project Guidelines

Your project should conform to the following set of guidelines:

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I can:

- See a table of all transactions.
- Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table _ the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend _
- Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.
